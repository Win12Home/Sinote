### 0.06.25542
1. **Add feature**: Add **+** button to create new Tab. (I forgot add it in 0.06.25530)
2. **Add feature**: It automatically restores last session every start. (It won't be restore your cursor position.)
3. **Re-write**: Object *SpacingSupportEdit* **re-write** and discard before version. **(Before was written by AI)**
4. **Add feature**: Support **Fallback Font**. (Normal will be ***MiSans VF***)
5. **Add feature**: Support **Theme change**. (It's different from FluentCpp, it can change, but it need not to re-start application.)
6. **Add feature**: Support **open file with argument**. Like ``Sinote.exe MyFile.txt``, Sinote will open MyFile.txt!
7. **Optimize**: Optimized start time. (My old PC, CPU: ``Intel i3-2120 @ 3.3GHz``) Before: ``8s+`` Now: ``1.98s-3.68s``
8. **Add feature**: Sinote is wrong, its truly name is ```Arguments++```. (JOKE) Exactly, add ``--only-create-cache``, ``--no-color/-nc``, ``--no-theme/-nt``, ``--record-log/-rl``. Look Help for learn more.
9. **Something not important**: Add software icon.
10. **Add feature**: Add **Plugin Setting** for config your plugin!
11. **Add software**: Add **Sinote CLI** (SinoteCLI.py) for create plugin quickly.
